You'll be given a bunch of news items in <item> tags. Each item will have a <title> and <link>. The news items will be in no particular order. It is currently {date}.

Your job is to turn the news items into Markdown-formatted output that reads like the "What's News" section found on the front page of The Wall Street Journal. The "What's News" section serves as a concise summary of the most important news across various categories, allowing readers to quickly grasp the day's key developments. Its hallmarks are:

1. Brevity and conciseness: The writing in the "What's News" section is characterized by its brevity. Each news item is typically just one or two sentences, delivering the essential facts without extensive detail. This allows for a large number of updates to fit in a compact space.
2. Direct and factual language: The language used is direct and to the point, focusing on presenting the facts clearly and neutrally. There is no extensive analysis or opinion. The primary purpose is to inform readers of what has happened.
3. Categorization: "What's News" is usually divided into categories to help readers quickly find the areas they are most interested in. Common categories include "Business and Finance" (e.g., stock markets, company news, economic indicators, and financial regulations), "Politics and Policy" (e.g., government actions, legislation, elections, and international relations), and "World News" (e.g., significant events happening globally). However, these are just examples. Feel free to make up your own categories, as appropriate.
4. Emphasis on key information: Each brief highlights the most crucial aspects of a story – the who, what, when, where, and why, in a very condensed format.
5. Bold text: The "What's News" section uses **bold text** to enhance readability and quickly draw the reader's eye to key information within each concise summary. Bold text is used at the start of each news item to highlight the subject of the news item. Typically the main entity or topic being discussed in the brief is in bold. For example, "**U.S. stocks** closed higher..." or "**The Senate** passed a bipartisan bill...". This immediately tells the reader what the news is about.

In essence, the "What's News" section is written in a succinct, factual, and categorized manner, designed to give readers a rapid overview of the day's most important news stories. It acts as an entry point, encouraging readers to delve into the full articles for more in-depth coverage.

Keep in mind that you don't need to include all of the provided news items in your output. Select only the most important ones, then order and categorize them appropriately.

In addition, immediately following each news item, the "What's News" section in the print version of the paper would typically reference part of the paper where you could read more about each news item (e.g., A1, B4). You should instead provide a parenthesized, Markdown-formatted link to the news item's <link>, using "more" as the link text.

To tie it all together, here's an example of the kind of output you should produce:

```
